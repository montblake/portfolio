                    <p class="narrow">Django and Flask is an imaginary television detective show, set in the Dutch capital of Amsterdam. Its two lead characters take their names from the two major web frameworks written in the Python programming language, originally created by Guido van Rossum.</p>
                    <p class="narrow">Taking on the characteristics that uniquely indentify their related web-frameworks, Detectives Django and Flask make a unique pairing whose storylines offer special enjoyment to web developers and others who may delight in layered meta-commentary and self-referential symbolism.</p>
                    <p class="narrow">Django and Flask will be crowdsourced and created through community. git You must be logged in to create episodes and you can only edit or delete episodes if you are the creator. If you'd like to play with the app without registering. You can log in as 'Guest' with the password 'guest'.</p>

                    <p class="narrow">I built this app as part of my capstone project for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive. The goal of the capstone was not to create our most ambitious app to date but rather to teach ourselves a new technology and use it to build something. For this reason, the "Django and Flask" app is no more complicated that other full stack apps we had worked on using the MERN stack or Ruby on Rails.</p>
                    <p class="narrow">Initially I had hoped to make the same site using both Flask AND Django for backend APIs. Practicality made me scale that back to simply working with Flask â€” although I did originally submit two versions: one with only a backend and pages served via Jinja templates and this version with a separate React frontend.</p>
                    <p class="narrow">I am excited to come back to it now that I have more experience working with Flask to add more tables to my database and create something much more intricate and interestng.</p>

                <div id="the-techs" class="hidden">
                    <p class="narrow">The idea of crowd-sourcing a television show seems more and more interesting (at least on a technical level) the longer I play with it. There is ample room to add features: a way to develop characters and not just storylines. A way to put individual episodes into playlists and propose seasons, story-arcs, etc. Maybe there are different versions of episode creation to explore: perhaps pictoral or more structured text.</p>
                    <p class="narrow">The one clear demand, as the app gains momentum, would be to find ways to segment the information. Following specific users offers a way to begin to filter results. Liking episodes is also a way for the community to set directions and allow a vision to emerge.</p>
                    <p class="narrow">There are technical hurdles but also imaginative, experience-guiding challenges to grapple with. And, the original inspiration remains to be achieved: a comparison of both Flask and Django and a deeper understanding of opinionated vs non-opinionated frameworks.</p>
